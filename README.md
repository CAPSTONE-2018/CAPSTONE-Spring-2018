## Introduction
In this course, you will work in a team of 2-4 students to complete a "real-world" project.  The selected projects are for non-profit organizations and all are web-based applications.  I realize that you may not have much experience with the languages and technologies being used, but this will be a common experience for you as you go out into the business world.  I will assist you and will try to point you to appropriate tutorials when possible, but you will be expected to do some research on your own.  

Projects will be completed using an agile approach.  Your team will be expected to identify and complete a minimum of 3 sprints.  A sprint is a set period of time during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. The completion of each sprint will be considered a mandatory milestone and **failure to complete the sprint will result in being dropped from the course**.
