 Heart Haven Outreach (H20)* is a close partner of the Service Learning office and we've worked with them before in Computer Science. They are located in Bolingbrook, they work with underprivileged / struggling high school youth and their families. They provide social, educational, and recreational opportunities and I think they do a great job at it.  They could use help in determining to collect student data more effectively. They also administer a pre-post survey of participants and are interested in moving it to a mobile app format.  This doesn't need to be a mobile app, but could be a responsive web app.
